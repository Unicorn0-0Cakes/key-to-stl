# 📸 Image Guidelines for Best Results

## Ideal Key Photo Requirements

For optimal STL conversion, your key photo should match these specifications:

### ✅ **Orientation**
- **Vertical orientation** - Key pointing UP/DOWN (not sideways)
- Head (bow) at top, blade pointing down
- Completely straight alignment

### ✅ **Background**  
- **Plain white or light solid color background**
- No patterns, textures, or shadows
- High contrast between key and background
- Clean, uncluttered surface

### ✅ **Lighting**
- **Even, diffused lighting** from above
- No harsh shadows under or around the key
- Avoid glare or reflections on the metal surface
- Natural daylight or soft white LED works best

### ✅ **Focus & Clarity**
- **Sharp, in-focus image** of the entire key
- Clear bitting (teeth) details visible
- All edges crisp and well-defined
- Minimum 1920x1080 pixels recommended

### ✅ **Framing**
- Key should fill **60-80% of the frame**
- Equal spacing on all sides
- Flat against surface (not angled or tilted)
- Entire key visible (head, shoulder, blade, tip)

## 🎯 Reference Example

Your photo should look as close as possible to this:

**Key characteristics:**
- ✅ Vertical orientation
- ✅ Clean white background  
- ✅ Sharp focus on entire key
- ✅ No shadows or glare
- ✅ High contrast edges
- ✅ Bitting details clearly visible

## ❌ **What to Avoid**

- ❌ Horizontal/sideways orientation
- ❌ Busy or patterned backgrounds
- ❌ Blurry or out-of-focus images
- ❌ Heavy shadows or poor lighting
- ❌ Key at an angle or not flat
- ❌ Low resolution images
- ❌ Partial key (cropped head or tip)
- ❌ Multiple keys in frame

## 📱 **How to Take the Perfect Photo**

### Using Your Phone:

1. **Setup:**
   - Place key on white paper/poster board
   - Position near window for natural light
   - Lay flat - no tilting or propping up

2. **Positioning:**
   - Stand directly above the key
   - Phone parallel to surface
   - Key centered in frame, vertical orientation

3. **Capture:**
   - Tap to focus on the key
   - Ensure no shadows are cast
   - Take multiple shots from same position
   - Review for sharpness before uploading

4. **Editing (Optional):**
   - Crop to center the key
   - Adjust contrast if needed
   - Ensure white background is truly white

## 🔍 **Quick Checklist**

Before uploading, verify:

- [ ] Key is vertical (head up, blade down)
- [ ] Background is plain and light-colored
- [ ] Image is sharp and in focus
- [ ] No shadows visible
- [ ] Entire key is in frame
- [ ] High resolution (1920x1080+)
- [ ] Good contrast between key and background

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- Use a tripod or steady surface for your phone
- Shoot in RAW format if possible
- Take photos during daytime with natural light
- Use a white foam board as a background for best results
- Clean the key before photographing to ensure clear edges
